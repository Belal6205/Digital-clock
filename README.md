## 📥 Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/digital-clock.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd digital-clock
   ```

3. Ensure you have the background image file named `big ben.jpg` in the project directory

4. Open `Digital clock.html` in your web browser

## 🎮 Usage

Simply open the HTML file in any modern web browser. The clock will automatically:
- Display the current time
- Update every second in real-time
- Show the correct AM/PM indicator
- Maintain proper formatting with leading zeros

The clock requires no user interaction and runs continuously once loaded.

## 🎨 Customization

### Changing the Background
Replace `big ben.jpg` with any image file and update the CSS:
```css
background-image: url('your-image.jpg');
```

### Modifying Colors and Styling
Adjust the clock appearance in the CSS:
```css
#clock {
    color: white; /* Change text color */
    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7); /* Change background opacity */
    font-size: 5rem; /* Adjust font size */
    backdrop-filter: blur(10px); /* Modify blur intensity */
}
```

### Switching to 24-Hour Format
Modify the JavaScript function:
```javascript
// Remove or comment out the 12-hour conversion lines
// hours = hours % 12 || 12;
```
